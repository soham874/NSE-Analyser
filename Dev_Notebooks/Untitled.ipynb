      "Published: Fri, 04 Oct 2024 14:08:00 GMT\n",
      "Text: HYDERABAD: AM Green BV (AMG) and Maharatna public sector giant GAIL (India) Limited have joined hands to explore the setting up of solar and wind hybrid renewable energy projects of up to 2.5GW across India.The partnership will also focus on the long-term supply of carbon dioxide (CO2) for hybrid renewable energy projects and eMethanol production and exploration across India.The two players plan to take up studies for long-term supply of around 350 KTA CO2 generated by GAIL in its gas processing plants to produce eMethanol, an environmentally friendly fuel that can reduce carbon emissions and promote a circular economy, AM Green said on Friday.GAIL will also have an equity option to invest in the proposed eMethanol project, ensuring a strategic partnership that supports both companies’ objectives in promoting sustainable energy solutions, it added.The hybrid solar and wind projects combined with Greenko’s upcoming pump storage projects are poised to supply round-the-clock power to end users, including the proposed eMethanol project, the Hyderabad-based player said.The two players signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with GAIL executive director for business development and exploration & production Sumit Kishore and AM Green group president Mahesh Kolli inking the pact in the presence of GAIL director for business development Rajeev Singhal.AM Green group president Mahesh Kolli said the partnership with GAIL on one of the world’s largest carbon-free, renewable energy supply contracts demonstrates AM Green’s emerging leadership position as a global clean energy transition solutions platform while contributing to India’s ambition of emerging as an exporter of reliable, sustainable and lowest cost green molecules and its derivatives accelerating industrial decarbonisation globally.The production of green methanol will also help in decarbonisation of hard to abate sectors like shipping, steel and cement, among others, he added.GAIL director for business development Rajeev Singhal said: “By facilitating the supply of CO2 for eMethanol production, we are taking a proactive approach to reduce carbon emissions and support alternative fuel development. Development of renewable energy projects will support reducing the carbon footprint of the country and advance India's transition to a greener energy landscape.”AM Green said its production of green ammonia across multiple locations in India will accelerate its target to achieve 5 MTPA of green ammonia capacity by 2030, and its efforts to achieve net zero targets in India as well as in OECD markets.“This will be equivalent to about 1 MTPA of green hydrogen, representing a fifth of India’s target for green hydrogen production under the country’s National Green Hydrogen Mission and 10% of Europe’s target for green hydrogen imports by 2030.”AM Green also plans to establish large-scale bio refineries that utilize multiple feedstocks and produce high-value green products enabling global decarbonization in aviation, fuels, chemicals and other industrial sectors.\n",

      "Published: Fri, 04 Oct 2024 13:24:46 GMT\n",
      "Text: India's foreign exchange reserves crossed $700 billion for the first time on record, after climbing for seven straight weeks, on valuation gains and the central bank's dollar purchases.\n",
      "\n",
      "The forex reserves were at $704.89 billion, having risen by $12.6 billion in the week through Sept. 27 in their biggest weekly increase since mid-July 2023, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data showed on Friday.\n",
      "\n",
      "India's forex reserves have ballooned by $87.6 billion so far in 2024, already more than the near-$62 billion increase over the whole of last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the week corresponding to the latest reserves data, the rupee strengthened past 83.50 to the dollar, likely spurring the RBI to step in to shore up its reserves.\n",
      "\n",
      "For several months, the RBI has intervened on both sides of the market to keep the rupee in a narrow trading range, which has made it the least volatile among emerging market currencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, on being questioned on the rupee's lack of volatility last month, said that higher volatility did not benefit the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overseas inflows into the nation’s stocks and bonds have helped the Reserve Bank of India boost its stockpile to $705 billion, the fourth highest in the world. The amount provides stability to the rupee against external shocks, with the RBI using its reserves to limit extreme swings in the currency hovering near a record low.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reserves will likely rise to $745 billion by March 2026, giving the central bank more potential firepower to influence the rupee, according to Bank of America.\n",
      "\n",
      "The growth in FX reserves will be driven by a balance-of-payments surplus, owing to a smaller current-account deficit, the analysts wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "India is only the fourth economy in the world to cross $700 billion in reserves after China, Japan, and Switzerland.\n",
      "\n",
      "The country has been boosting its forex reserves since 2013, when foreign investors pulled out due to weak macroeconomic fundamentals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since then, stricter control on inflation, higher economic growth as well as narrower fiscal and current account deficits have helped draw in foreign funds, boosting reserves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Foreign inflows hit $30 billion so far this year, led mainly by investments in local debt after they were included in a key J.P. Morgan index.\n",
      "\n",
      "RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has repeatedly stressed the need to build a forex buffer to act as a shield during periods of market volatility.\n",
      "\n",
      "India's foreign exchange reserves scaled a new high again, crossing the USD 700 billion milestone.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the week that ended on September 27, the forex reserves kitty rose USD 12.588 billion to USD 704.885 billion, as per the data released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week, the kitty was at the previous high of USD 692.296 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "This buffer of foreign exchange reserves helps insulate domestic economic activity from global shocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the latest data from the apex bank, India's foreign currency assets (FCA), the largest component of forex reserves, were at USD 616.154 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gold reserves are currently worth USD 65.796 billion, as per Friday's data.\n",
      "\n",
      "As per estimates, India's foreign exchange reserves are now sufficient to cover over a year of projected imports.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the calendar year 2023, India added about USD 58 billion to its foreign exchange reserves.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, India's forex reserves saw a cumulative decline of USD 71 billion in 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forex reserves, or foreign exchange reserves (FX reserves), are assets held by a nation's central bank or monetary authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "Foreign exchange reserves are generally held in reserve currencies, typically the US Dollar and, to a lesser extent, the Euro, Japanese Yen, and Pound Sterling.\n",
      "\n",
      "The RBI closely monitors the foreign exchange markets and intervenes only to maintain orderly market conditions, aiming to contain excessive volatility in the exchange rate without reference to any pre-determined target level or band.\n",
      "\n",
      "The RBI frequently intervenes in the market through liquidity management, including the sale of dollars, to prevent a steep depreciation of the rupee. A decade ago, the Indian Rupee was one of the most volatile currencies in Asia.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it has since become one of the most stable. The RBI has been strategically buying dollars when the rupee is strong and selling when it is weak. A less volatile rupee makes Indian assets more attractive to investors, as they can expect better performance with more predictability.\n",
      "\n",
      "India's forex reserves jumped by USD 12.588 billion to a new all-time high of USD 704.885 billion for the week ended September 27, the Reserve Bank said on Friday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall kitty had swelled by USD 2.838 billion to USD 692.296 billion in the previous reporting week. The USD 12.588 billion would be one of the highest weekly rises ever and this is the first time the reserves have crossed the USD 700 billion mark.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the week ended September 27, foreign currency assets, a major component of the reserves, increased by USD 10.468 billion to USD 616.154 billion, the data released on Friday showed.\n",

      "Published: Fri, 04 Oct 2024 13:12:18 GMT\n",
      "Text: NSE\n",
      "\n",
      "India’s foreign exchange reserves have surpassed $700 billion for the first time, reaching $704.89 billion in the week ending September 27. This increase of $12.59 billion marks the largest weekly rise since mid-July 2023, as reported by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).According to the RBI's Weekly Statistical Supplement, foreign currency assets (FCAs) increased by $10.4 billion, bringing the total to $616 billion. These FCAs, expressed in dollar terms, reflect the impact of fluctuations in the value of other currencies such as the euro, pound, and yen held in India’s forex reserves.In addition to this, gold reserves saw a notable rise of $2 billion, reaching $65.7 billion. Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) experienced a modest increase of $8 million, now standing at $18.547 billion. However, India’s reserve position in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) witnessed a slight decrease of $71 million, settling at $4.3 billion for the week.The rise is attributed to a combination of dollar purchases by the RBI and positive valuation adjustments.With this achievement, India joins the ranks of only three other economies—China, Japan, and Switzerland—that have crossed the $700 billion threshold in reserves. The country has been steadily building its forex reserves since 2013, a response to capital outflows during periods of weak economic fundamentals.Factors such as strict inflation control, robust economic growth, and improved fiscal and current account balances have contributed to the influx of foreign capital.\"The rise includes surges in foreign currency assets and gold reserves, while SDRs increased and the IMF reserve position fell slightly. The surging reserves have been facilitated by overseas inflows into India’s stocks and bonds,\" said Manoranjan Sharma, Chief Economist, Infomerics Ratings.So far in 2024, foreign inflows have reached approximately $30 billion, primarily driven by investments in local debt after their inclusion in a key J.P. Morgan index. Notably, India's forex reserves have increased by $87.6 billion this year alone, outpacing last year's total increase of nearly $62 billion.\"India’s forex reserves have been on an upswing since 2013, when India was part of the “fragile five” part category and foreign investors exited because of weak macroeconomic fundamentals. Since then, an effective check of the inflationary spiral, accelerated economic growth, squeezing of fiscal and current account deficits, and abiding faith in the India growth story have led to a surge of foreign funds,\" Sharma added.The recent rise in reserves was bolstered by the RBI's dollar purchases of $4.8 billion, alongside $7.8 billion in valuation gains attributed to declining U.S. Treasury yields, a weakening dollar, and rising gold prices.As the rupee strengthened past 83.50 to the dollar, the RBI has actively intervened in the currency market to maintain stability, making the rupee one of the least volatile currencies among its emerging market peers.Looking ahead, India’s forex reserves are projected to grow further, with forecasts from Bank of America suggesting that they could rise to $745 billion by March 2026. This increase would provide the RBI with greater flexibility and influence over the rupee’s valuation in the global currency markets.\n",

      "Published: Fri, 04 Oct 2024 13:11:13 GMT\n",
      "Text: In a tough week for Indian stock markets, Sensex plunged by over 4,100 points, wiping out Rs 16 lakh crore of investor wealth. This sharp decline was caused by global factors, including the escalating Iran-Israel conflict and stimulus measures from China, leading to a strong sell-off across sectors. In Thursday's session, Sensex dropped by 1,769 points, before settling with a loss of 809 points. Nifty too fell, testing the 25,000 mark, dropping nearly 1%.\n",
      "\n",
      "advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the last five trading sessions since September 27, Sensex has dropped 4,148 points. The combined market capitalisation of companies listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) has shrunk to Rs 461.26 lakh crore, marking a loss of Rs 15.9 lakh crore.\n",
      "\n",
      "This week was the worst for Sensex and Nifty since June 2022. Sensex ended the week with a 4.3% drop, while Nifty saw a 4.5% fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, explained, \"The recent gains for both Nifty and Sensex were short-lived as concerns from the Middle East and the flow of foreign funds to cheaper Asian markets hit investor sentiment. During the week, benchmark indices corrected by more than 4%. The decline was broad-based, with sectors like auto, banking, infrastructure, and energy underperforming, although the IT sector showed minimal impact due to improved sentiment regarding spending and revenues after a shift in US Fed policy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The combined effects of rising tensions in the Middle East and China's stimulus package have made foreign investors cautious, particularly in emerging markets like India. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) pulled out significant amounts of capital, contributing to the stock market's fall. FIIs have withdrawn nearly Rs 32,000 crore from Dalal Street in the last four trading sessions, with Rs 15,243 crore being sold on Thursday alone — the highest-ever single-day FII selling.\n",
      "\n",
      "China's stimulus and Middle East tension\n",
      "\n",
      "China’s recent economic stimulus measures, aimed at boosting its economy, led many investors to shift their focus to Chinese markets. Stocks in China were trading at cheaper valuations compared to Indian stocks, causing FIIs to move their funds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran has further dampened investor sentiment. Iran launched nearly 200 missiles towards Israel in retaliation for an Israeli airstrike, raising concerns about a prolonged conflict in the region. As a result, investors have become even more cautious in moving their capital into emerging markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The market’s broad-based fall has impacted most sectors. However, IT stocks remained somewhat insulated from the sell-off due to improved sentiment following the easing of the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy.\n",

      "Nifty's technical trends\n",
      "\n",
      "Nifty, which ended below its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 25,556, saw increased selling pressure. A break below 25,150 added further selling momentum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Technical analysts, however, suggest that the market may find support soon.\n",
      "\n",

With Nifty having fallen 4.5% from its high of 26,300, and almost six trading sessions down, we expect this support to hold. If Nifty breaks below the current levels, we still don’t see anything significantly negative.\"\n",

      "The Nifty witnessed an extremely volatile day of trade on Friday, witnessing sharp swings in both directions and closed in the red, merely sustaining above the 25k mark, but dropping slightly below the 50 DEMA.The index has shed 1,310 points (-5.2%) after making a fresh high of 26,277 last week.A bear candle was formed on the daily as well as the weekly charts. The near-term uptrend of Nifty has turned down sharply. Having placed at the supports of around 25,000, there is a hope of a minor upside bounce in the early week, which is expected to be a sell-on-rise opportunity. A decisive move below 25,000-24,950 levels could open the next downside of 24,500 in the near term. Immediate resistance to be watched around 25,300, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities.In the open interest (OI) data, the highest OI on the call side was observed at 25,200 and 25,300 strike prices, while on the put side, the highest OI was at 25,000 strike price.On the daily charts, we can observe that the Nifty has been declining for the last five trading sessions and has corrected around 1,200 points form the high of 26,277. It is now approaching the support zone of 25,000 – 24,800, which coincides with the 50-day moving average and the 61.82% Fibonacci retracement level of the Aug – Sept rally. We expect the Nifty to hold on to this support and stage a counter trend pullback as the hourly momentum setup is sporting a positive divergence which indicates loss of momentum on the downside. On the upside pullback likely towards 25,500.The Nifty witnessed a bear attack for the second consecutive day. Sustained trades below key levels triggered a correction towards 25,000. The sentiment has turned extremely weak, with higher levels being used as selling zones. On the lower end, the next support is seen at 24,750, while on the higher end, resistance is visible at 25,300.The market has broken below the trendline connecting the higher lows of the last two months, confirming a channel breakdown. With prices closing just at the key 50 EMA support, this has been one of the sharpest weekly drops in recent times, forming a strong bearish candle on the weekly chart, signalling more potential downside ahead. The next key support is around the September swing low of 24,750 followed by 24,500. However, traders should exercise caution with short positions, as some in-between bounces cannot be ruled out due to oversold conditions in momentum indicators on intraday charts. On the upside, Friday's high near 25,500, which coincides with the 20 EMA and the channel breakdown level, will act as a stiff resistance, with 25,300 being the immediate resistance before that.Nifty after a dead cat bounce, at the start of the day, again fell almost 2% from the day's high. It is however takingsupport at 25,000 levels. Another bounce can come at the present levels, which also looks to be short-lived. Nifty has closed below the Upper band of the Keltner channel, a strong signal of a further fall. All the momentum indicators are in the over-sold region, which can be a possible reason for a small bounce which is expected to be short-lived. Options writer's data showed a significant increase in call writing and also ITM puts short covering, indicating weakness in the index to continue.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

      "Text: Stock Market Crash: Domestic equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty 50 extended losses for the fifth straight session on Friday, October 4, in an exceptionally volatile session, and logged their worst week in over two years amid weak geopolitical tensions and foreign outflows. Today's crash comes after a two per cent decline seen in the previous session.\n",
      "\n",
      "The frontline indices lost about 4.5 per cent each for the week, their worst since June 2022, with most of the decline due to a two per cent slump on Thursday. Overall the indices have ended the truncated September 30-October 4 week after three straight weeks of positive returns. From their record highs scaled on September 27, the benchmarks have dropped over five per cent.\n",

      "Falling for the fifth day running on Friday, the 30-share BSE Sensex tumbled 808.65 points or 0.98 per cent to settle at 81,688.45. The benchmark hit a low of 81,532.68 and a high of 83,368.32 during the day, reflecting a wild swing of 1,835.64 points during the session.\n",

      "\n",
      "1.Israel-Iran war: Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East Tensions are high in the region after Israel killed Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, followed by increased attacks against the Hezbollah militia in Lebanon and Houthi militia in Yemen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ongoing tensions in the Middle East, particularly between Israel and Iran, have added volatility to global markets, especially with crude oil prices rising by over five per cent in the past two days. The situation escalated after a missile strike in Beirut and retaliatory threats between Israel and Iran.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The increase in geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran weighed on risk assets. In global news, mounting geopolitical tensions have contributed to a shaky start for the stock market in October,\" said Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research at Kotak Securities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Iran launched over 180 ballistic missiles at Israel. Experts say the fresh escalation has made investors cautious, driving them away from risker equities and betting on safe-haven assets like gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Polymarket, a decentralized prediction platform, currently forecasts a 38 per cent chance of an Israeli response to Iran's attack by Friday. This could lead to a potential shift of capital into safe-haven assets like gold,\" said Justin Khoo, Senior Market Analyst APAC, VT Markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2.Rise in global crude oil prices Escalating tensions in the Middle East have driven up crude oil prices, with Brent crude futures rising more than one per cent on Friday, resulting in a substantial week-to-date gain of 10 per cent. The heightened Middle East tensions significantly impact oil price oversupply concerns, given that this region accounts for one-third of global oil production.\n",
      "\n",
      "One-fifth of the world’s crude passes through the Strait of Hormuz. Fears are mounting that Israel could retaliate by targeting Iran's major oil fields, which would likely push oil prices even higher. The only factor limiting the gain in oil prices is the December supply-output plan by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+).\n",
      "\n",
      "“The bearish sentiment continued as investors monitored the escalating conflict in the Middle East and adopted a sell-on recovery strategy. Crude prices have increased sharply but may be restricted due to increased production from OPEC+,\" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.\n",
      "\n",
      "The drag was across sectors led by realty, auto, and FMCG, except IT stocks, which gained due to expected benefits from US rate cuts and their defensive nature. The pessimism on the market is expected to continue in the near term amidst rising crude prices, and fund flows to cheaper markets like China,” added Nair.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.FII outflow Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) offloaded equities worth ₹15,243.27 crore on Thursday, a record high. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were the most significant sellers during the recent market downturn, withdrawing nearly ₹30,613 crore from Indian markets over the last three trading sessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "A substantial portion of this selling occurred on Thursday alone, amounting to ₹15,243 crore, marking the largest daily outflow by foreign investors in the last four years. There are growing concerns about FPIs shifting investments back to China, especially as Beijing has implemented a series of policy measures to revive its struggling economy and bolster its capital markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The last three days have witnessed huge FII selling of ₹30,614 crore in the cash market. FIIs are moving money from expensive India to cheap Hong Kong on expectations that the Chinese authorities monetary and fiscal stimulus will stimulate the Chinese economy and improve the earnings of Chinese companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It remains to be seen how this Chinese recovery hopes to play out. The market direction in the near term will be influenced by the tug-of-war between the FIIs and DIIs,\" said Dr V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4.SEBI's new regulatory F&O trading norms Capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) implemented six of seven measures recommended by an expert panel to cool the exuberance in India's booming derivatives market and curb the rush in F&O trading.\n",
      "\n",
      "The six that could impact volumes the most are the reduction in weekly expiries per exchange from five to just one, the increase in lot size to ₹15-20 lakh from ₹5-10 lakh, and the removal of the calendar spread benefit on expiry day. SEBI’s latest F&O regulations introduce changes that will impact market participants in varying ways, which is why the stock market is taking time to digest these announcements.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Discount brokers like Zerodha and Groww, which cater to retail traders, may experience lower trading volumes due to the increase in contract size and restriction of weekly expiries to one benchmark index per exchange. In contrast, traditional brokers and wealth managers may face less impact, as their client base consists of more institutional and HNIs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The limitation on weekly expiries could benefit the BSE, as it may attract traders shifting from NSE. While discount brokers and retail traders are expected to adjust to these changes, AMCs and depositories will likely remain unaffected. RTAs may experience operational changes without significant disruptions,\" said Krishna Appala, Senior Research Analyst at Capitalmind Research.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.China's fiscal stimulus lure foreign investors Experts say China's recent stimulus measures could lure foreign investors away from India due to the former's cheaper valuation. According to Dr. V K Vijayakumar of Geojit Financial Services, one significant factor influencing foreign portfolios is the outperformance of Chinese stocks, reflected in the massive surge in the Hang Seng index by around 18 per cent in September.\n",
      "\n",
      "This surge has been triggered by hopes of a revival in the Chinese economy in response to the monetary and fiscal stimulus announced by the Chinese authorities. China's central bank will cut banks' reserve requirement ratio (RRR) by 50 basis points, releasing about one trillion yuan ($142.21 billion) for new lending. Moreover, China's central bank will cut the seven-day reverse repo rate by 0.2 percentage points to 1.5 per cent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The cheap valuations of Chinese stocks are keeping the momentum intact. This can be a tactical trade that can be sustained for some more time. This means FIIs may continue selling in India and move more money to better-performing markets. FII selling is unlikely to impact the Indian market significantly since the massive domestic money can easily absorb whatever the FIIs are selling,\" said Dr. V K Vijayakumar.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Technical View: D-Street experts say corrections such as this can be categorized as technical corrections, as the Indian growth story remains intact. Such corrections should be expected, especially when markets are at an all-time high.\n",
      "\n",
      "“While there may be a pause or slight rebound after the recent slide, the overall bias will remain negative unless Nifty decisively reclaims the 25,600 level. Key sectors such as IT, metal, and pharma show resilience, while others face selling pressure during rallies. Traders should adjust their positions accordingly and consider adopting a hedged approach,” said Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking Ltd.\n",
      "\n",
      "Historically, these technical corrections have been brought into play, particularly with the high cash levels available to domestic investors. One should use this opportunity to nibble into quality stocks and deploy incremental money into their mutual fund portfolios.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Though this correction may feel painful, it will look like an opportunity in hindsight, similar to the correction of election results. Retail investors should maintain their asset allocation and rebalance their assets if we witness a meaningful correction of 10 per cent or more during this technical phase,\" said Lt. Col. (Retd.) Rochak Bakshi, Founder and CEO of True North Financial Services.\n",
